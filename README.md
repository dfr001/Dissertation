# Dissertation
Code used when writing my dissertation, "[Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests to Detect One-Sided Mixture Alternatives in Group Sequential Clinical Trials](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3f28b3mc)."

The `grp.seq.mix` function is used to determine arm size needed for a study based on a given design alternative.
